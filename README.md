# Run-YOLOv8-in-One-Line-on-Jetson

Do you want to deploy Yolo on Jetson using a single line commandï¼ŸThis repo can help you achieve. Considering that red error messages during the environment setup process can potentially affect everyone's mood, we have decided to hide most of the warnings and error messages.

Before deploying YOLOv8, please ensure that you have a [hardware device](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J4011-p-5585.html?queryID=7e0c2522ee08fd79748dfc07645fdd96&objectID=5585&indexName=bazaar_retailer_products) with an installed [operating system](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reComputer_J4012_Flash_Jetpack/).

The only command you need to execute is:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yuyoujiang/Run-YOLOv8-in-One-Line-on-Jetson && python Run-YOLOv8-in-One-Line-on-Jetson/run.py <password>
```
